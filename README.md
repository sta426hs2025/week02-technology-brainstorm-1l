Single-cell RNA sequencing

Bing Search - Copilot Search: prompt "Single Cell RNA sequencing"

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and complex biological systems. In constrast to bulk RNA sequencing, the transcriptomes of individual cells are analysed, revealing how different cells behave and respond within a given environment. scRNA-seq involves cell isolation, RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing including bioinformatic analyses. It has a wide range of applications across various fields, e.g. in cancer research where it is used for understanding tumor heterogeneity and identifying distinct cell populations within tumors.
